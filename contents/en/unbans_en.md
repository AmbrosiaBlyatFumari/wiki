## Unban requests and complaints procedure.

Before filing an application you should create [issue](https://github.com/discordia-space/wiki/issues) on our wiki repository. Your application name should meet one of these templates:

**[Unban] (your BYOND account), (ban period)** - for regular unban/jobban request.

**[Unpermaban] (your BYOND account)** - for unpermaban request.

**[Discord unban] (your Discord account)** - for unban/restriction removal request on our Discord server.

**[Complaint] (your BYOND account), (administrator BYOND account)** - for complaint against administration.

Request itself should follow these rules:
* You should come forward with the cause of the ban without any rewriting or retelling, you must provide it as it is. In case of complaint against administration bans which you are notice must also provide the cause as it is. The cause should be provided to you when you enter the game. Discord makes an exeption, where administration will provide you the cause.
* All requests and complaints should be represented in neutral tone without any provocations. Describe the chronology calmly, and point out on administration mistakes. Do not try to make drama of your application.
* It is preferably to add game logs to your words. You can always ask administration for it.
* Regular unban request could only be written once, unpermaban request - once in three months.

Administration can decline your application if it's not written in accordance with the rules. Be patient, substantiate your actions, and you will be heard.
