<h1>Backstory</h1>
<p>Within hive cities where smoke gushes through corroded streets, in closed and unfriendly space communities, in isolated colonies — that is where people live. The shards of their civilization, remained after the Split happened. In a little nook of the Galaxy, enclosed from our past, we struggle with each other over and over. Corporations devouring their rivals, planetary nations are fighting for the priceless resources, mysterious guilds are weaving the shroud of politics. Some may say that we have studied nothing, and doomed in our repetition of ancestors’ mistakes. Others may say that only this way humanity can exist.
<p>But still humanity are surviving. We discovered that ancient alien empires were only ruins, and this knowledge encouraged us in our unaccountably peckish for space, which was opened for colonization... And yet we wanted much more.</p>
<p>In the year 2343, an old ship has departured to territories of the Alliance of Humanity, once the powerful empire, which colonized the half of the Milky Way. But it had been destroyed by a weapon of unbelievable might — now reality sometimes collapses in its borders, and rare survivors are not humans anymore. The crew of this ship contains a huge variety of personalities: different kinds of scientists, engineers-anarchists, PMC with an arsenal which is enough to conquer a tiny colony, agents of various intelligents, smugglers, rogues… And you are one of this motley brigade.</p>
Welcome aboard.</p>
