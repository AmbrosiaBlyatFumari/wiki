|0. Administration applies these rules on its discretion.|
| :------------ |
|That means that Administration is free not to punish for violations if it's necessary, or if there's no grievances to the offender.|

|1.  Don't be an asshole.|
| :------------ |
|This is just a game, and we here for enjoyment. Long-timed conflicts, intentional harm to community, toxic behavior are not allowed, and will be punished. This rule doesn't regulate minor conflicts.|

|2.  Please, do your job.|
| :------------ |
|Engine must be started in correct times, people shouldn't die in medbay's reception while doctors are having tea, and so on. Remember, that the safety and status of the whole ship are depend of crucial roles' work. Heads and AI must not leave after round's start. But if you have your serious reasons which does not allow you to work, it's ok.|

|3.  Multi accounting.|
| :------------ |
|This disrupts Administration's work, and punishes hard. If you want to change your account, you should discuss it with the Administration. Admins can use multi accounts for their purposes.|

|4.  Intentional murder/isolation/infliction of grievous bodily harm without any reason.|
| :------------ |
|You should have strong cause for killing. It can be: selfdefence, long-time roleplayed conflict, the fulfillment of the order(The one who gave an order to you will be responsible) and the enforcement of the sentence.|
|The violation always will be considerated in context of events, which were earlier. Usually, the one who generate the situation is the one who takes responsibility.|
|Full isolation of the player = kill.|
|Infliction of grievous bodily harm, which causes long healing in medbay (more than 30 minutes) punishes in half.|

|5. Do not use IC knowledge, which is unknown to your character.|
| :------------ |
|Do not use IC knowledge that you knew by ООС-way.|
|Do not use other roles' difficult devices. Base operations, like wall dismantling, are free for all, but surgery and engine fitting could be done only by specialists. With the exception of related posts, like robotics, or Jacks-of-all-trades: scientists and RD.|
|The crew is aware of existing of all special roles and have approximate information about their methods, but doesn't know anything about their skills and devices.|

|6. Breaking the immersion.|
| :------------ |
|Your manner of speaking must fit to your roleplaying, but not to your regular chat-behavior. Ideally, your speech should be literary as much as possible. Without any emojis, internet-slang or text-cuts: your characters are communicate by voice.|
|Do not interrupt the setting and lore.
|When you use flavor text, you don't allow to write character, story or something like this. Only your appearance (and some OOC notes if it's needed).
|Do not take the famous people names (Adolf Hitler) and too much popular characters (Darth Wader). You can roleplaying not so famous heroes, but you should agree it with administration first.|

|7. Communicate correctly.|
| :------------ |
|It's hard to roleplaying, when adult characters, spaceship crew, talking like schoolboys. Please be correct as much as it possible: your text must be comfortable to read.|
|There are two language-separated servers: Russian and English. General interaction must fit to the server's language.

|8. IC in OOC.|
| :------------ |
Talks about current round's events are banned. It's also applies to forums and other ways of communication.|

|9. Out-of-game cooperation.
| :------------ |
|Any out-of-game ways of communication does not allowed. This is metagame, that will be punished hard.

|10. ERP.|
| :------------ |
|Erotic roleplay is restricted, because of autistic influence to the game process. Hugs'n'kisses are allowed, but no more then. You heard the man.
