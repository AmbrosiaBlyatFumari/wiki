<h1>Exodus from the Earth</h1>
<p>21st Century became crucial in the history. In local conflicts, trade deals, and research laboratories future has been created, and it wasn’t perspective. </p>
<p>To the year 2070, China’s economical and military power was in no doubt. His enormous government machine had its eyes on all things, and also had big plans on the Earth. Other countries decided to throw all powers on developing and building spaceships and engines in order to escape the planet, leaving it on Dragon’s mercy. Of course, the Chinese Dragon himself had no objections.
Newest researches in hyperspace technologies (aka bluspace) allowed to reach big ranges, allowed to fly away from the Earth. Colonist chose the Big Hound galaxy as their target. It was located not far away from Milky Way, and the date of approach was around year 2200</p>
<p>Americans were the first ones to fly away to the stars. They took the best scientist, engineers, priceless equipment from all around the world, and departured. The most of theirs financing came from american corporations. Nanotrasen, which will be later famous for its trade fleets, their bases, enormous hive cities, was among them. 
<br>The second wave was mostly formed from european settlers, and also from those who had enough money to buy a ticket into the future. That’s why the amount of space vessels was higher. 
They settled wider than Americans, their focus was to form small and independent colonies and organizations. Soon after the colonization started, interests of these minor factions required protection from enlarged expantion of Nanotrasen in the region. That’s how Syndicate was formed.
<br>The last wave was all Russians. They spent twenty years to develop the fastest engine, and built only two huge ships with the most modern equipment aboard. 
<br>They thought that these ships would allow them to colonize several planets at once, and then will be used as protectors and transports. 
<br>But it had never happened. After twenty years of flight in cryostasis, the engine malfunctioned and caused accidents on both ships. 
<br>The first, “Krusenstern”, had not been found ever. The second, “Bellingshausen”, was trapped in an anomalous space among the dangerous asteroids, but despite this, brave colonists had survived, and later became known as Technomants.</p>

<p>China, the last state on the Earth, formed the Alliance of Humanity, which goal was to bring people to progress and prosperity. 
What could possibly went wrong.</p>
